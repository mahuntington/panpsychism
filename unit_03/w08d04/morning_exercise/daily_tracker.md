# Dialy Tracker for Project Work

Beginning with Project 3, you will be asked to create a daily tracker for your work. Some of you have already started using a tracker for Project 1 and/or Project 2. There are many ways to go about doing this, but we will cover two today.

Choose a tool that you will want to use and look at each day. One that can help you be agile with your development - adjust want you need to adjust, move what needs to be moved, etc. If you're collaborating on a project, make sure that it's a tool that can easily be shared and your collaborators can be tagged on actions as well.

## My approach
- When I create a project tracker, I always include my user stories. By doing this, I can look back on them each to to confirm that I'm focused on what needs to be accomplished in the big picture.
- Break it down, day by day. Make one column for each day in Trello or mark the date in your Github issue - whatever you're going to do, break it down to bitesize pieces for each day. Remember to include the final day  - presentation day - in your tracker!
- Divide and conquer. Your user stories give you the big picture of what needs to be done in your app, now break each user story down into actions that you need to take in order to accomplish that user story.

## Activity

### Your pretend project:

You are given a project to work starting on Monday, January 1 and your presentation is due on Monday, January 8. You are working on this project alone, and have the following information:

User stories:
1. The user should be able to go to app URL and immediately see a game board.
2. The users should be able to set their name.
3. The users should be able to play the game with at least one other player.
4. The user should see if they won or lost.

Your MVP
1. An interactive board which renders on page load
2. A way for players to set their name
3. A way for players to mark an empty space on their turn
4. The game should end when there is a winner, or if the game is a tie
5. The game should report the end state

Your Stretch Goals
1. A button on `game over` to reset the game back to initial state
2. A way to keep track of Player 1 vs. Player 2 wins
- An option to play vs. a computer with AI
  - Level 1: Random empty space is good enough
  - Level 2: Computer chooses a space which immediately blocks a player win
3. Add in the ability to store a game to play later.  This might use Firebase or local storage to do so.
4. Add in the ability to play live with somebody remotely.  This will definitely need to use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).

### Make your tracker

1. Trello
- Create a new Trello board called `tracker-practice`
- Create a daily plan of action in Trello (each column should be a separate date)
- Use labels
- Stretch: Add stickers

2. Github
- Create a new repo on Github called `tracker-practice`.
- Create a daily plan of action in Github issues
- Use labels
- Stretch: Use Milestones
