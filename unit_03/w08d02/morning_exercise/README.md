# Morning Exercise

In this morning's exercise, I want to introduce you to some of the product management tools that you will be encountering on the job and also get you familiar with Trello. You will be using Trello to keep track of your 3rd project (and beyond!).

## Using Trello & Agile Development

### Jira

### Trello

We're doing small applictions and don't need all the fancy stuff that comes with Jira, so we'll use *Trello* to mimic the flow that most of you will be using during production!
