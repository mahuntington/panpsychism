# Morning Exercise

In this morning's exercise, I want to introduce you to some of the product management tools that you will be encountering on the job and also get you familiar with Trello. You will be using Trello to keep track of your 3rd project (and beyond!).

## Agile Development

## Scrum

#### History of Scrum (reference can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))

Scrum was first defined as "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal" as opposed to a "traditional, sequential approach" in 1986 by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in the New Product Development Game.[5] Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in The Knowledge Creating Company[6] that it is a form of "organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally".

The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer industries.[7] They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth".[7] (In rugby football, a scrum refers to a tight-packed formation of players with their heads down who attempt to gain possession of the ball.[8])


## Using a tracker in Agile Development

### Jira

### Trello

We're doing small applictions and don't need all the fancy stuff that comes with Jira, so we'll use *Trello* to mimic the flow that most of you will be using during production!
