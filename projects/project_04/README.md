# Final Projects

## Outline

Build three projects from the following four options

- Ruby on Rails CRUD App
- MEAN Stack App
- Portfolio Site
- Site Redo

Once the three are complete, choose one of them to expand and make **AMAAAAZIIIING**.  This will be the site that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

## Requirements

### Ruby on Rails CRUD App

Create a traditional server side CRUD application, similar to a Checklist or Todo app

- Deploy to Heroku
- Index page has a link to the new page
- New page contains a form for creating a new item.  Submits to create page
- Create page just updates the DB and redirects back to the index page
- Index page has links to all the items' show pages
- Show page shows information about a specific item
- Show page contains a link to the item's edit page
- Edit page allows you to edit information for that item and submit to update page
- Update page just updates the DB and redirects back to show page for that item
- Show page contains a form which submits to the delete page
- Delete page just updates the DB and redirects back to the index page

### MEAN Stack App

Create a single page application, similar to a Checklist or Todo app

- Deploy to Heroku
- Items should contain a name and at least one other property
- Application initially contains a list of item names currently in the DB
- Application initially contains a form for creating a new item
- Upon submission, the form creates the item in the DB.  Application automatically updates to show new item name in the list of item names
- Clicking on an item name in the list of item names displays an information panel for the item, which shows all info about the item
- The information panel contains a delete button which deletes the item from the DB.  Application automatically updates the list of item names
- Clicking on information about the item in the info panel converts that information into an editable field
- Changing the value of an editable field in the info panel updates the DB and converts the editable field back into static information

### Portfolio Site

Create a site that shows off your work

- Deployed to github pages
- Contains a list of your current projects
- Contains your resume
- Contains your bio
- Contains a list of links to various sites in the tech world that you follow
- Contains a link to your github profile
- Contains a link to your linkedin account
- Must be functional for all screen sizes (responsive)

### Site Redo

Find the web site of a company/entity in your town/local area that sucks and redo a page of it.  Pro tip: local government and small mom/pop shops are almost always ripe for redesign!  Once you graduate, you can go the company/entity and show them the site.  Maybe they'll hire you to finish it!

Requirements:

- Deployed to github pages
- Must be functional for all screen sizes (responsive)
- For mobile and tablet, create a different navigational system that is easy to use on small devices (http://www.bmo.com/main/personal has a good one)
