## Walkthrough: Rails CRUD app


We will be making a new Rails CRUD app with a single model called `neighborhood`, with routes, controllers, and views. We will be making much of this manually without scaffolds or generators for controllers and models. This way, you will develop some muscle memory and a greater understanding of each step of the process.

Rails is a framework that favors **convention** over **configuration**, so it is important to name your folders, files, and classes with the correct combination of upper/lowercase letters and plural/singular business.


### 1. INITIALIZE APP
1. Make a new Rails app
`rails new neighborhoods --database=postgresql`

2. **Go into your new directory**

3. Run `bundle install` to install all your gems

### 2. DATABASE AND MIGRATIONS
1. Create your database from the same directory
`rake db:create`

2. Test that the db has been created with `rails dbconsole`.
Then quit the console.

3. Make a new migration:
`rails g migration CreateNeighborhoods`. The g is short for generate, and Create is a rails keyword helper for making migration files for your database. `Neighborhoods` must be *plural* and have a *capital first letter*. There is no space between Create and Neighborhoods. It's `CreateNeighborhoods`.

4. In your sublime in your project folder, open up your migrate folder in your db folder, and you should see a migration file that looks like a bunch of numbers. You will add your model columns and datatypes into this file: A neighborhood should have a name, borough, description, population, and img_url. It should look like this when you are done with it:

```
  def change
    create_table :neighborhoods do |t|
	    t.string   "name"
	    t.string   "borough"
	    t.text     "description"
	    t.string   "population"
	    t.text     "img_url"
    end
  end
```

5. Migrate your schema to your database *after* you have entered the information into your migration file. Run the migration with
`rake db:migrate`. This will create a `schema.rb` that you never touch.

**IMPORTANT: Once a migration has run, you never edit your migration or schema file. It is there forever as a record of all your migrations. To edit a migration, you make a new migration to act on the previous one**

Therefore, make sure all your info is correct the first time.

Test that your table has been made by going into the console and typing `rails dbconsole`. Perform a SELECT to test then quit the dbconsole.


### 3. MODELS
1. Create a model. In the app/models folder, create a file called `neighborhood.rb`. It has to be **singular lower case** or it will break. 

2. Inside neighborhood.rb make a class called Neighborhood **singular, uppcase N** that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base

3. Seed your database with data for your models, two Neighborhood entries. In db/seeds.rb in your project folder, you can make seeds like the following:

```
Neighborhood.create({
  name: "Flatbush", 
  borough: "Brooklyn",
  description: "Founded in 1651 by Dutch colonists, Flatbush consists of several subsections.",
  population: "110,875",
  img_url: "http://subwaynut.com/irt/flatbushn2/flatbushn215.jpg"
})
```

4. To import your seed into your database, run `rake db:seed` in terminal.

5. Test that your seed worked by going into `rails dbconsole`, performing a SELECT query, and then quit.

6. Test your model by opening up Rails console `rails c`, and querying `Neighborhood.all`, then quit.


### 4. ROUTES
1. In config/routes.rb add `resources :neighborhoods`.  
Test your routes by typing `rake routes` in the console. You should get this:

```
      Prefix       Verb   URI Pattern                       Controller#Action
     neighborhoods GET    /neighborhoods(.:format)          neighborhoods#index
                   POST   /neighborhoods(.:format)          neighborhoods#create
  new_neighborhood GET    /neighborhoods/new(.:format)      neighborhoods#new
 edit_neighborhood GET    /neighborhoods/:id/edit(.:format) neighborhoods#edit
      neighborhood GET    /neighborhoods/:id(.:format)      neighborhoods#show
                   PATCH  /neighborhoods/:id(.:format)      neighborhoods#update
                   PUT    /neighborhoods/:id(.:format)      neighborhoods#update
                   DELETE /neighborhoods/:id(.:format)      neighborhoods#destroy
```

You can delete all the extraneous comments in routes.rb



  
### 5. CONTROLLER
1. In your app/controllers folder, manually create a new file
called `neighborhoods_controller`. **The word neighborhoods must be lowercase and plural or the app will break.**

2. Inside `neighborhoods_controller` make a new class called `NeighborhoodsController` that inherits from ApplicationController. **The word Neighborhoods must be plural with an uppercase first letter, and Controller must have an uppercase C**

3. Add the seven methods that correspond to your seven restful routes: index, create, new, edit, show, update, destroy. You don't need to put anything into these methods for now.


### 6. VIEWS

1. In the app/views folder, make a folder for your neighborhoods views. It should be called `neighborhoods` **lowercase plural**.

2. In your views/neighborhoods folder, start by making a view file called `index.html.erb`. This corresponds to your index method in your controller.


### 7. TEST: CONTROLLER -> VIEW

Make an instance variable in your neighborhoods#index controller method. Set it to a string, such as `@test = "America Burger USA 2015 github.com.biz.usa.patty"`.

In your neighborhoods view folder, in `index.html.erb`, write some erb that will display the instance variable: `<%=@test%>` 
  
When you go to access the url `/neighborhoods` in your browser (your index url), you should see the value of `@test` on your screen.
  
  
### 8. COMPLETE YOUR CONTROLLER

Fill out your controller. Note that in the example below, variables below are named `@item` or `@items` or `Item`: your app will not have variables called `item`. You will probably want to use `@neighborhood` or `@neighborhoods` and query the `Neighborhood` model.

Note that we are using `strong params` here in `create` and `update` by referring to a private method the restricts the params we are going to make and/or update.

Your `create`, `update` and `destroy` routes will need redirects. These redirects correspond to the prefixes in your `rake routes` with a `_path` appended.

Example using an Item model instead of a Neighborhood model:

```
  def index
    @items = Item.all
  end

  def new
    @item = Item.new
  end

  def create
    @item = Item.create(item_params)
    redirect_to items_path
  end

  def edit
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
  end

  def update
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
    @item.update_attributes(item_params)
    thom waz here-- don't copy-paste code
    redirect_to items_path
  end

  def show
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
  end

  def destroy
    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
    @item.destroy
    redirect_to items_path
  end

  private

  def item_params
    params.require(:item).permit(:gossipgirl, :rupaulsdragrace, :mrrobot)
  end
```


## 9. COMPLETE YOUR VIEWS

All of your GET routes will need views. `index`, `show`, `edit`, and `new` are GET routes. Complete the views for `index` and `show`. 
  
- Each item in your `index` should link to that item's `show` page. 

- Make forms inside the views that require forms: `edit` and `new`. 

- An item's `show` page should have a link to `delete` that item. Put it in `show`.

- Also on the `show` page, provide a link to `edit` that item.

This tutorial gives complete, basic examples of using views, as well as some other useful stuff: <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html">Blogger2 Tutorial</a>



## 10. MAKE STATIC PAGES


- Make some extra, static pages for your Rails app. How would you make an `about` or `contact` page?

- Add routing in your `routes.rb`, to tell Rails where to look when certain routes are hit:

```
  get '/about', to: 'static#about'
  get '/contact', to: 'static#contact'
```

- In this case, we're telling Rails to look in a controller called 'static', and further to look at the actions called `about` and `contact`. Make a controller, call it `static_controller` to handle these static pages. This controller requires no models, migrations, etc. It's just a controller. 

- The actions in the controller correspond to the pages themselves. `def about`, and `def contact`. These correspond to views that you will make in a `static` folder or `pages` folder in your `views`.



## 11. EXTRAS

- Set your root to the index.

- Use partials to render your forms.

- Do some very basic styling on your app with css stylesheet in the assets folder.

- Look into a CSS framework like `Bootstrap`, `Skeleton`, `Pure`, or `Foundation`, and implement styling on your pages using one of those.

- Add data validation to your model

- Try out giving your app some JavaScript functionality through the assets folder. 



## 12. FIFO / BONUS
#### Make a second model with a one-to-many relationship

Let's expand our neighborhoods beyond NYC, and make a new model called City. A city **has many** neighborhoods. A neighborhood **belongs to** a city.

- Create a migration files for cities.

- In your neighborhood.rb model file, specify this relationship with `belongs_to: cities`
- In your city.rb model file, specify this relationship with `has_many: neighborhoods`

- The neighborhood table will need a column for the foreign key. Run a migration that will add a `t.belongs_to :city` column in your neighborhoods table. This is the foreign key.

- Get it all working such that when you add a new Neighborhood, you specify the city, and can then see an index of cities, wherein you can see each city's neighborhoods.
