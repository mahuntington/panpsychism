# MEMORY LANE - Part 1

Remember all the morning exercises we did in Javascript? Let's revisit these exercises one-by-one. We already have an idea how to approach them having done them before, so let's try to solve them again while also translating them to Ruby.

### 1. EULER PROBLEM 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### 2. PALINDROME
Make a ruby method that returns true if a string is a palindrome, false if not. Make sure it returns the correct result for words with capital letters.

### 3. BUBBLE SORT

### 4. PRIMES

### 5. BONUS: RECURSIVE FACTORIAL
