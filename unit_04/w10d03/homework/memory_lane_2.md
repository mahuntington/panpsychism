# MEMORY LANE - Part 2

Remember all the morning exercises we did in Javascript? Let's revisit these exercises one-by-one. We already have an idea how to approach them having done them before, so let's try to solve them again while also translating them to Ruby.

### 6. WORD FREQUENCY

### 7. 100 GOBLINS
NOTE: Using `for` loops is not really the Ruby way. Look up the following looping methods: `.times`, `.step`, and `.each_with_index`.
