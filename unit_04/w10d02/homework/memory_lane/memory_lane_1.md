# MEMORY LANE - Part 1

Remember all the morning exercises we did in Javascript? Let's revisit some of these exercises one-by-one. We already have an idea how to approach them having done them before, so let's try to solve them again while also translating them to Ruby.

### 1. EULER PROBLEM 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### 2. PALINDROME
Make a ruby method that returns true if a string is a palindrome, false if not. Make sure it returns the correct result for words with capital letters.

### 3. PRIMES

* Write a method called `prime?` that will test whether a number is Prime. The method will return true if Prime, false if not.

* Write another method called `primes_list` that will print all the Primes up to an arbitrary limit. For example, if you invoke your method with `primes_list(100)`, it will print all the Prime numbers up to and including 100. 

This method can call on the previous `prime?` method.

```
A Prime number is a number that is not evenly divisible by another number except 1 and itself.

To test whether a number is Prime, you only need to test as far as the **square root** of that number. This
is advisable for optimization and testing large numbers.
```
