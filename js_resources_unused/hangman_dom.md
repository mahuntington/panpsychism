![hangman](http://teniesonline.ucoz.com/avatar/87/080458.gif)

Last weekend you had a ton of fun with hangman in the console. This weekend your assignment is to make your hangman solution playable in the browser. Feel free to use your existing solution, if you are not comfortable with your solution you may also use our solution to the problem. **PRO TIP** You may have to adapt the existing solutions to work with the DOM. 


###User Stories

* As a user I would like to be able to push a start button and have a game start and render in the browser.
* As a user I would like to be able to see what letters I've played
* As a user I would like to be able to see how many guesses I have left
* As a user I would like to be able to see the current status of the word, with hidden letters represented by underscores and guessed letters represented by their value.
* As a user I would like to be able to use an input box on the page to guess my letters


###Bonuses

* As a user I would like to see a visual representation of hangman similar to the picture above. 
* As a user I would like my letter inputs to be dictated by keypresses, so if I push the `K` key on my keyboard it will guess `k`
