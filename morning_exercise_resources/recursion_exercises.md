#### RECURSION EXERCISES

0. Look at the 'recursion notes' file (in the same folder as this file).

1. Take your solution to Euler problem 2 and make it so that it uses recursion to solve part or all of the problem. https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

2. Read up on Binary Tree Search: 
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/binary-search/a/implementing-binary-search-of-an-array

3. Code an algorithm that performs a Binary Tree Search using recursion.

4. Go back and look at your solution to the Factorials problem, and see if you can make it work if it doesn't already.
